SBE uses an Intermediate Representation (IR) between data layout mechanisms and code generators and on-the-fly decoders. [SBE Tool](wiki/SBE-Tool-Guide) can generate serialized IR via the `sbe.ir.filename` option. This generates a file, commonly using the .sbeir extension, that can serve as input to SBE Tool instead of XML for code generation. In addition, the On-The-Fly (OTF) decoder, requires serialized IR for decoding. In this section, we will explore how to generate IR and use it, as well as how IR works.
