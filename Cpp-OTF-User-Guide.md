Some applications, such as network sniffers, need to process messages dynamically and thus have to use the [Intermediate Representation](Intermediate-Representation) to decode the messages on-the-fly (OTF). An example of using the OTF API can be found [here](https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding/blob/master/examples/cpp98/SbeOtfDecoder.cpp).

The C++ OTF decoder follows the [design principles](Design-Principles) of the generated codec stubs.

**Note**: Due to the dynamic nature of OTF decoding, the stubs generated by the SBE compiler will yield greater relative performance.
