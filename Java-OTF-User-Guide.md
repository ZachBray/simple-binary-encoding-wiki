Some applications, such as network sniffers, need to decode messages dynamically and thus have to use the [Intermediate Representation](wiki/Intermediate-Representation) to decode the messages on-the-fly (OTF).

The Java OTF decoder follows the [design principles](wiki/Design-Principles) of the generated codecs and is thread safe to be reused concurrently across multiple threads for memory efficiency.

**Note**: Due to the dynamic nature of OTF decoding, the stubs generated by the SBE compiler will yield greater relative performance.
