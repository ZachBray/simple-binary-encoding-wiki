### 1.3-RC3 (06 Jan 2016)
* Updated implementation to reflect the [RC3 Specification](https://github.com/FIXTradingCommunity/fix-simple-binary-encoding/tree/master/v1-0-RC3/doc). RC3 is more generally useful with support added for var data in repeating groups and composites that can contain other types than just primitive encodings.
* Significant rewrite of Java and C++ OTF implementation to be more efficient with no back or re-scanning of the IR, plus they are now similar in usage and API.

* IR updated to carry the description and count of tokens per component.
* Other language implementations have been removed until ports for RC3 are available.
* Project structure updated to be a Gradle modular build.
* RC4 features are available for testing if appropriate RC4 XSD schema is provided or schema validation is turned off.
* Generated code is marked with the @Generated annotation.
* C++ updated to C++ 11.
